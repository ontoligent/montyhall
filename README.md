# The Monty Hall Problem

This repo contains a computational representation of the solution to the Monty Hall Problem as given in the paper, ["What's So Hard about the Monty Hall Problem" (Alvarado 2024)](./alvaado-2024.pdf). The essay presents a simple Bayesian solution to the problem along with a probabilistic graphical model to provide semantic coherency to the solution (as defined by Judea Pearl; see essay for reference).
